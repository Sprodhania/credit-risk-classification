# credit-risk-classification
**Instructions**
This challenge is divided into the following key steps:
- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

**Step 1:** **Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**
- Open the starter code notebook and follow these steps:
- Load the lending_data.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Separate the target variable (y) from the features (X). The target variable is the loan status column, while the remaining columns serve as predictors.

**Step 2: Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data**
- Train a Logistic Regression Model using the training dataset (X_train, y_train).
- Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset (X_test).

**Modelâ€™s Performance Evaluation with:**
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

**Finally Address the following question:**
- How accurately does the model classify both healthy (0) and high-risk (1) loans?
